		<p>
			My hobbies include: Films, Film making, Video games (especially VR) and Board games.
			I also like to work with arduino coding and making keyboards. I also like getting out
			and doing outdoor sports like archery, airsoft, and backpacking. Even though that last
			one isnt technicaly a sport.
			<a href="https://www.instagram.com/jonnyplaid/" target="_blank"> Instagram</a> really the only thing worth anything on it is the spicy keyboard :/

			As of right now I am in my second year of school here and would
			like to major in digital cinema. Mainly because when I enter the work force,
			My end goal is to see my own name in the end credits of a movie.
			Id also settle for just knowing I worked on it, beggers can't be choosers and all that.
